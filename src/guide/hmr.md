# HMR

Thanks to VueJS/ViteJS, **TroisJS use watchers and HMR to update three.js objects when you update a template or a prop**. This means the result in your browser will be automatically updated without reloading all the stuff. **This is really helpful when you are creating a TroisJS Scene**.

Most of the props are reactive, please take a look at components source to see exactly which ones.
